Our group worked collaboratively on this lab and portfolio entirely on replit.com. The site allowed multiple users to edit files in real time and view the changes made to our webpage. 

We created an index html page, a single css file, and a resources and an individual profiles folder. The resources folder stored all of the images that we used in our group and individual portfolios while profiles folder held each of our individual resumes. We started off with a navigation bar that allowed us to access each individual portfolio from the index page. Then, we included images of every group member and screenshots of our previous works. Other stylistic choices we made allowed the user to click the image to view a portfolio and a three column layout for the previous works. Our team members are displayed in a two by two table with their respective names and photos. Eventually, we added a navigation bar to every portfolio to enhance the mobility between pages. At the bottom of the page, there is a progress bar along with our curent tasks for our project. 

Regarding challenges - one of our first complications involved using a "global" css file, because our previous resumes from intro to ITWS all had different stylistic choices. Thus, we decided to settle on using one template that served as the baseline for each of our resumes such that we would not need to use unique CSS. This change allowed for us to have a more uniform site overall. Additionally, after some vigorous searching online, we found that we could actually use CSS to format the hcard microformatting that we used on our HTML. 

We chose to include a web-based font, taken from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/). The name of the font is "Playfair Display", and it was imported into our style.css file. It is used throughout the web application, finding use into all of our head and body tags.

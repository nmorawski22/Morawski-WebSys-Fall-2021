WebSys Fall 2021, Section 02 Repository

I was tasked to work on the amendments and present them in a creative way. I started later than other members of my group, so I started my page off similar to another group members. There are 27 amendments to the Constitution, but only the first ten required further annotation, so I stored Amendments 11 through 27 in accordion drop-down text boxes, similar to how Yasmine stored the articles she was analyzing. After completing the latter amendments, I created a pull request of my current work. Then I tried to use JavaScript to make a description box pop up on an onMouseover event, but quickly realized it did not look as clean as I imagined. Instead, after some research on W3Schools, I found out you can make custom tool tips using CSS, So I followed a guide and emerged with text boxes that popup when the cursor is hovering over a specific div class. I set up the Bill of Rights in a table to make its information more accessible, as well as manipulated the tool tips location. All of the Amendments on the left side of the table would have their tool tip pop up in the left margin; all of the Amendments on the right side of the table would have their toot tip pop up in the right margin. I was considering putting images in the tool tips, as the annotations are geared towards children who may not understand te language of the original text, but that proved to be a very tedious job, which I quickly scrapped.

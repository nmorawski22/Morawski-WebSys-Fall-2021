Morawski README

    For starters, I looked through the Frankfurter API and the given code to figure out how to 
properly utilize the data I am retrieving. I then bult the site, featuring some headings for the title
and a div section for the main part of the converter. I also used buttons for the five monetary units I chose.
The plan was for the code that was inputted in the input tag to be read through JS, then converted based on what button was clicked

    My creativity was to come in with the coloring and style of both the web application and the font.

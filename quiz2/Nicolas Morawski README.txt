I had no issues creating the two necessary tables, "items" and "discounts". Upon trying to enter
the given SQL code, I got an error.to fix the code, I needed to add a single quotation mark after 
"'OpenBSD Tshirt", as well as change the character that was at the end of "'AMD Ryzen 9 3900Xâ€™", as
it is not recognzied as a single quote.

I ran out of time, so I have included the MySQL file of the database created, along with the two tables.
Both tables also include the desired inputs.
